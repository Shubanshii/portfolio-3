                <p>So who am I? <br><br>
                Um ... Can't you see my picture?  I'm Mance Rayder, The King Beyond The Wall. <br><br>
                Joke aside, I do love Game of Thrones.  Last few seasons were lame, but the first few seasons
                were great.  Favorite show is The Sopranos (I'm only 3 seasons in at the time of writing, but if it maintains
                this level of quality, it will be my favorite).
                <br><br>
                My hobbies at this point are web development and music.  

                I love conceptualizing and building web applications, and learning new technologies to facilitate this.
                I take great joy in putting my mind to a problem and solving it.  Coding challenges are fun.

                I also love composing guitar-driven music and singing.

                I think there is an overlap with composing and coding.  In the beginning of both one's coding journey
                and composing journey, one encounters frustration.  Making complex rhythms and jazzy chords and progressions work can 
                be difficult.  It often takes time.  However, if you have a firm belief that you CAN make it work as long as you keep returning to the music
                until it's finished, you will get there.  I think coding is exactly like this.  The problems you want to solve ARE solvable.
                It's simply a matter of coming back to it until you get where you're trying to go.

                Reach out if you want to know more, and check out my applications.
